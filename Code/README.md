## 🧹 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Each annual dataset (2017–2022) underwent a standardized and reproducible data cleaning process. The script included:

- Importing raw data from Excel files using `readxl`
- Initial inspection using `summary()` and `names()`
- Selection of relevant variables based on a predefined protocol
- Renaming variables for consistency across years
- Type conversion for dates, factors, and numerics using `lubridate`, `dplyr`, and `forcats`
- Re-labeling categories using INS dictionaries
- Recoding unknown or inconsistent values
- Systematic handling of missing data
- Exporting cleaned datasets as `.Rds` and `.RData` files

> ⚠️ The same process was applied to all datasets, with slight adjustments for annual structural differences.

See the full procedure in `01_data_cleaning.R`.

## 🧮 2. Data Manipulation and Exploration

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This script standardizes variables across years (2017–2022) for analysis. Key steps:

- Date validation (`fech.not`, `fech.hech`)  
- Age grouped into health system-relevant categories  
- Re-labeling of sociodemographic and violence-related variables  
- Creation of thematic groups (e.g., by type of violence, relationship to aggressor)  
- Generation of simplified, analysis-ready variables  
- Export of `.Rds` files

**Time Analysis (2020 Focus)**  
- Binary classification of events by period (`periodo.hecho`, `periodo.not`)  
- Validation of consistency  
- Dataset split into `vio.2020.before` and `vio.2020.pandemic`

**Time Delay Computation (2017–2022)**  
- Calculated `dif.dias` (event-to-notification delay)  
- Computed summary stats (mean, median, SD)  
- Histograms visualized and exported  
- Outlier filtering: negative or >30-day delays

**Final Outputs**  
- `.c` files saved annually (e.g., `vio.2017.c`)  
- Combined histogram plots exported  
- Full-period dataset `vio.todo` created, labeled by period

## 🧾 3. Descriptive Analysis

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Stratified Analysis by Sex and Pandemic Period</strong></summary>

This section presents descriptive statistics stratified by:

- **Sex**: Female / Male  
- **Pandemic period**: Prepandemic / Pandemic  

###  Steps:

- Datasets were split:  
  `vio.before.female`, `vio.before.male`, `vio.pandemic.female`, `vio.pandemic.male`

- **Continuous variables**: Summarized with `describe()` (e.g., age, time delay)

- **Categorical variables**: Summarized with `tabyl()` + `adorn_percentages()` (e.g., occupation, violence type)


</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Descriptive Analysis by Age Cohorts</strong></summary>

Survivors were grouped into official age cohorts:

- **Children**: 0–5 (early), 6–11 (childhood), 12–17 (adolescence)  
- **Adults**: 18–26 (youth), 27–59 (adulthood), 60+ (older adults)


###  Steps:

- Each **sex × period** subgroup was split by age group

- Frequencies and distributions were recalculated

- Factor levels were cleaned and harmonized across years

- Tables were exported for reporting and annexes

## 🎯 4. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)

<details>
<summary><strong>🧪 Dataset Preparation and Variable Recoding</strong></summary>

###  Datasets:

- `vio.before.MCA`: Prepandemic  
- `vio.pandemic.MCA`: Pandemic  
- `vio.todo.MCA`: Combined (includes `Period` variable)

###  Preprocessing:

- Selected 10–11 categorical variables (e.g., `Sex`, `Activity`, `Violence`, `Relation`, etc.)

- Translated variable names to English

- Recoded values:
  - `"Sí"` → `"Yes"`  
  - `"Phsychological"` → `"Psychological"`  
  - `"Civic leaders and students"` → `"Students and civic leaders"`

- Saved final datasets as `.Rds` files

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📈 MCA Execution and Scree Plots</strong></summary>

###  Execution:

- Ran `MCA(..., ncp = 3)` using `FactoMineR`

- Extracted eigenvalues via `get_eigenvalue()`

###  Scree Plots:

- Created using `fviz_screeplot()`  
- Red dashed threshold line at **4.9%**  
- Exported as `.pdf` (e.g., `Screeplot.vio.todo.pdf`)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📌 Variable Category Visualization</strong></summary>

###  2D Plots:

- Used `fviz_mca_var()` to plot:
  - Dim 1 vs 2  
  - Dim 1 vs 3  
  - Dim 2 vs 3

- Combined with `patchwork::plot_layout()`

- Labeled key categories with `geom_text_repel()` (e.g., `"Sexual violence"`)

- Shaded quadrants with `viridisLite::viridis()` palette (color blind friendly palette)

- Saved as `.pdf` (e.g., `categorias.MCA.vio.before.todo.quadrant.pdf`)

###  3D Plots:

- Created with `plotly::plot_ly()`  
- Labeled axes with variance explained  
- Saved as `.html` (e.g., `3D_MCA_Categories_with_Todo.html`)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Plots of Individual Records by Violence Type</strong></summary>

###  2D Plots:

- Colored by `Violence` group  
- Added confidence ellipses (95%) with `fviz_mca_ind()`

- Used `viridis_d` color scale  (color blind friendly palette)
- Saved as `.pdf` (e.g., `individuals.pandemic.vio.pdf`)

###  3D Plots:

- Built with `plot_ly()`  
- Grouped by `Violence` type  
- Interactive format saved as `.html` (e.g., `3D_MCA_individuals_prepandemic.html`)


See full script: `04_analysis_mca.R`

✅ Both the descriptive and MCA analyses were structured to maintain consistency across prepandemic, pandemic, and combined datasets, enabling valid comparisons over time.

## 🧪 5. Sensitivity Analysis

<details>
  
<summary><strong>Complete Case vs. Full Dataset Comparison</strong></summary>


This script conducts a sensitivity analysis to compare the original dataset (which includes missing data treated as a separate category) against a version with **complete cases only** (rows with no missing values). The goal is to test the robustness and stability of the **Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)** results.

Key steps include:

- **Quantification and Visualization of Missing Data**:
  - Overall and per-variable missingness.
  - Visual exploration using `missmap()` from the `Amelia` package.

- **Comparison of Variable Distributions**:
  - Key variables (`Sex`, `Type of violence`, `Pandemic period`) were compared across datasets using `tabyl()` and percentage formatting.
  - Stacked bar charts of `Type of violence` by `Sex` were created for both datasets to visualize differences.

- **Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) – Complete Cases**:
  - MCA was performed on the complete-case dataset using `FactoMineR::MCA()` with 3 dimensions.
  - Scree plot generated to examine variance explained.
  - Standard 2D MCA biplots (`Dim 1 vs 2`, `1 vs 3`, `2 vs 3`) were produced.
  - An integrated panel of all 2D plots was also saved.
  - A quadrant-shaded biplot of variable categories was created, highlighting key violence-related categories.

- **3D MCA Plots**:
  - Interactive 3D scatter plots of variable categories were built using `plotly::plot_ly()`.
  - Axes represent the three main MCA dimensions, annotated with explained variance.

- **Individual Record Plots**:
  - 2D plot of individuals by `Type of violence` with confidence ellipses.
  - 3D interactive plot with individuals colored by violence category.

> ✅ This sensitivity analysis allows for the evaluation of how missing data may impact MCA outputs and strengthens the transparency of the analysis.

You can explore the full procedure in the script `05_sensitivity_analysis.R`.
