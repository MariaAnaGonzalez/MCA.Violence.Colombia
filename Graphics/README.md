# 📁 Graphics Folder

This folder contains visualizations generated for the study, organized into four subfolders based on analytical phases:

- **Prepandemic**
- **Pandemic**
- **Combined (Prepandemic + Pandemic)**
- **Sensitivity Analysis**

Each subfolder includes 2D and interactive 3D plots produced during the descriptive and MCA phases of the analysis.

### 📊 Interactive 3D Visualizations

This repository includes interactive 3D plots derived from Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) of categorical variables related to gender-based and intrafamilial violence in Colombia (2017–2022). These visualizations support the findings presented in the manuscript and enable dynamic exploration of violence patterns across different periods: **prepandemic**, **pandemic**, **combined**, and **sensitivity analysis**.

Each plot is available in two formats:
- **Individuals Plot**: Each point represents a report, highlighting distribution and clustering according to the main type of violence reported.
- **Categories Plot**: Shows relationships among categorical variables and violence profiles.


#### 🔍 Violence Profiles Identified

The analysis identified four overlapping but distinguishable violence profiles:

- **Physical Violence** *(purple)*: Linked to intimate partners or ex-partners, private settings, and injury mechanisms such as blunt force or hanging.

- **Sexual Violence** *(yellow)*: Associated with public spaces, adolescent and child victims, and aggressors who are not part of the family circle.

- **Neglect and Abandonment** *(green)*: Characterized by female aggressors (often mothers), male victims in early childhood, and mechanisms such as burns.

- **Psychological Violence** *(blue)*: Positioned at the center of the MCA space, overlapping with all other types. This profile often co-occurs with physical aggression and involves older female victims and male aggressors.


📂 The interactive plots are located in the `docs/` folder and can be viewed in any web browser. They are also integrated into the GitHub Pages version of the repository.
