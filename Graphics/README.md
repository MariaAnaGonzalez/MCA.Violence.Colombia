# üñºÔ∏è Graphics Folder

This folder contains visualizations generated for the study, organized into four subfolders based on analytical phases:

- **Prepandemic**
- **Pandemic**
- **Combined (Prepandemic + Pandemic)**
- **Sensitivity Analysis**

Each subfolder includes 2D and interactive 3D plots generated during the MCA and descriptive phases of the analysis.

###  Interactive 3D Visualizations

This repository includes interactive 3D plots based on Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) of categorical variables related to gender-based and intrafamilial violence in Colombia (2017‚Äì2022). These visualizations support the findings presented in the manuscript and allow dynamic exploration of patterns across different periods: **prepandemic**, **pandemic**, **combined**, and **sensitivity analysis**.

Each plot has two formats:
- **Individuals Plot**: Each dot represents a case, highlighting dispersion and clustering.
- **Categories Plot**: Visualizes relationships between categorical variables and profiles.

####  Violence Profiles Identified

The analysis revealed four overlapping but distinguishable violence profiles:

- **Physical Violence**: Associated with intimate partners or ex-partners, private settings, and blunt force or hanging injuries.
- **Sexual Violence**: Linked to public spaces, adolescent and child victims, and aggressors who are often non-family members.
- **Neglect and Abandonment**: Characterized by female aggressors (often mothers), male victims in early childhood, and mechanisms like burns.
- **Psychological Violence**: Centrally located in the MCA space, reflecting overlap with all other types. It often co-occurs with physical mechanisms and involves older female victims and male aggressors.

Psychological violence forms the **core** of the configuration, with the other profiles forming a **triangular structure** around it‚Äîcaptured effectively in the 3D visualizations.
