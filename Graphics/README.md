# 🖼️ Graphics Folder

This folder contains visualizations generated for the study, organized into four subfolders based on analytical phases:

- **Prepandemic**
- **Pandemic**
- **Combined (Prepandemic + Pandemic)**
- **Sensitivity Analysis**

Each subfolder includes 2D and interactive 3D plots generated during the MCA and descriptive phases of the analysis.
