## Data Source
In Colombia, reporting of **GBV** and **IFV** is mandatory for epidemiological surveillance under **Law 248 of 1995**.  
For this study, we used data from the **National Institute of Health (INS - *Instituto Nacional de Salud*)** via the **SIVIGILA** system, which collects nationwide public health information.  

Clinicians report **GBV** and **IFV** cases using a standardized form during medical consultations (see the file **INS 875**). The data, including demographics and event details, are entered into **SIVIGILA** system, and analyzed primarily using descriptive statistics.  

As mandated by **Law 1712 of 2014**, all data are publicly available with ensured anonymization.

## Data Availability
According to the **Instituto Nacional de Salud** (INS) guidelines, the original and secondary data are restricted to the principal researchers and are not publicly accessible.  

However, researchers and the public can request access to the original data via the following link:

## Selected Variables and Rationale
Most variables in the official records are categorical, describing subjects' sociodemographic characteristics and event details such as the date, primary type of violence, and relationship with the aggressor.   

While the records include over 100 variables, we selected 19 for our research (see **Table 1**) based on exploratory analyses conducted during the pilot study.
