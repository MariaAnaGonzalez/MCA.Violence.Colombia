## Data Source
In Colombia, reporting of **GBV** and **IFV** is mandatory for epidemiological surveillance under **Law 248 of 1995**.  
For this study, we used data from the **National Institute of Health (INS - *Instituto Nacional de Salud*)** via the **SIVIGILA** system, which collects nationwide public health information.  

Clinicians report **GBV** and **IFV** cases using a standardized form during medical consultations (see the file **INS 875**). The data, including demographics and event details, are entered into the **SIVIGILA** system and analyzed primarily using descriptive statistics.  

As mandated by **Law 1712 of 2014**, all data are publicly available with ensured anonymization.

## Selected Variables and Rationale
Most variables in the official records are **categorical**, describing:

- Subjects' sociodemographic characteristics.
- Event details such as the date, primary type of violence, and the relationship with the aggressor.

Although the dataset includes over 100 variables, we selected **19 original variables** for our research (see **Table 1**) based on exploratory analyses conducted during the pilot study.

## Definitions
This study follows Colombia’s **official national institution definitions** for all variables and measures described below.

### [Gender Identity](#gender-identity)
An individual's self-identification influenced by social, historical, and cultural definitions of femininity, masculinity, or the spectrum between them [[1]].

### [Sex](#sex)
Refers to genetic, hormonal, and structural body traits [[1]].

### [Sexual Orientation](#sexual-orientation)
An individual's capacity for emotional, affectionate, and sexual attraction to people of a different, the same, or multiple genders, along with the ability to form intimate relationships [[1]].

### [IFV and GBV](#ifv-and-gbv)
According to **INS** protocols, **IFV** and **GBV** include:

- **Sexual violence:** Any sexual act forced upon someone against their will.
- **Physical violence:** Any act of aggression causing bodily harm (e.g., hitting or pushing).
- **Psychological violence:** Actions that harm mental or emotional well-being.
- **Neglect and abandonment:** Failure to meet the basic needs of vulnerable groups such as children, adolescents, older adults, or individuals with disabilities.

The **INS** also recognizes:
- Attacks involving chemical agents.
- Violence against children, adolescents, women, and individuals with non-normative gender identities or sexual orientations.
- Female genital mutilation [[2]].

The **INS** follows the **World Health Organization (WHO)**'s broader definition of violence, which includes:
