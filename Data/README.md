<summary><strong>üìç Data Source</strong></summary>

In Colombia, reporting of Gender-Based violence **GBV** and Intrafamily violence **IFV** is mandatory for epidemiological surveillance under **Law 248 of 1995**.  
For this study, we used data from the **National Institute of Health (INS - *Instituto Nacional de Salud*)** via the **SIVIGILA** system, which collects nationwide public health information.  

Clinicians report **GBV** and **IFV** cases using a standardized form during medical consultations (see the file **INS 875**). The data, including demographics and event details, are entered into the **SIVIGILA** system and analyzed primarily using descriptive statistics.  

As mandated by **Law 1712 of 2014**, all data are publicly available with ensured anonymization.

<summary><strong>üìä Selected Variables and Rationale</strong></summary>

Most variables in the official records are **categorical**, describing:

- Subjects' sociodemographic characteristics.
- Event details such as the date, primary type of violence, and the relationship with the aggressor.

Although the dataset includes over 100 variables, we selected **19 original variables** for our research (see **Table 1**) based on exploratory analyses conducted during the pilot study.

<summary><strong>üìò Definitions</strong></summary>

  
This study follows Colombia‚Äôs **official national institution definitions** for all variables and measures described below.

### [Gender Identity](#gender-identity)
An individual's self-identification influenced by social, historical, and cultural definitions of femininity, masculinity, or the spectrum between them [1].

### [Sex](#sex)
Refers to genetic, hormonal, and structural body traits [1].

### [Sexual Orientation](#sexual-orientation)
An individual's capacity for emotional, affectionate, and sexual attraction to people of a different, the same, or multiple genders, along with the ability to form intimate relationships [1].

### [IFV and GBV](#ifv-and-gbv)
According to **INS** protocols, **IFV** and **GBV** include:

- **Sexual violence:** Any sexual act forced upon someone against their will.
- **Physical violence:** Any act of aggression causing bodily harm (e.g., hitting or pushing).
- **Psychological violence:** Actions that harm mental or emotional well-being.
- **Neglect and abandonment:** Failure to meet the basic needs of vulnerable groups such as children, adolescents, older adults, or individuals with disabilities.

The **INS** also recognizes:
- Attacks involving chemical agents.
- Violence against children, adolescents, women, and individuals with non-normative gender identities or sexual orientations.
- Female genital mutilation [2].

The **INS** follows the **World Health Organization (WHO)**'s broader definition of violence, which includes:
- The use of force or the threat of force.
- Coercion or circumstances that limit the victim's ability to give free consent [3], [2].

<summary><strong>üõ†Ô∏è Data Transformation</strong></summary>

### Survivor‚Äôs Age
The quantitative variable **"Survivor‚Äôs age"** was categorized following Colombia‚Äôs **Ministry of Health** definitions:  
- **Early childhood:** 0‚Äì5 years  
- **Childhood:** 6‚Äì11 years  
- **Adolescence:** 12‚Äì18 years  
- **Youth:** 19‚Äì26 years  
- **Adulthood:** 27‚Äì59 years  
- **Older adult:** 60+ years [4]

---

### Event‚Äôs Date
The variable **"Event‚Äôs date"** was divided into two periods:  
- **Prepandemic:** 2017‚Äì2019  
- **Pandemic:** 2021‚Äì2022  

Data from **2020** was split according to Colombia's official pandemic start date (**March 25, 2020**) [5]:  
- Dates before this were classified as **"Prepandemic"**  
- Dates including this date and after this were classified as **"Pandemic"**  

A secondary variable was created to identify each period.

---

### Survivor‚Äôs Nationality
For the **"Survivor‚Äôs nationality"** variable, we categorized individuals into three groups:  
- **Colombian**  
- **Venezuelan** (to highlight GBV and IFV within the migrant community)  
- **Other** (all other nationalities)

---

### Survivor‚Äôs Occupation
The variable **"Survivor‚Äôs occupation"** was categorized using the latest **International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)** by the **International Labor Organization** [6]:  
- **Manual workers and craft jobs**  
- **Technicians and administrative support workers**  
- **Professionals and managers**  
- **Armed Forces Occupations**  

---

### Survivor‚Äôs Main Activity
The variable **"Survivor‚Äôs main activity"** was grouped into five categories for consistency:  
- **Other activities**  
- **Students and civic leaders**  
- **Domestic workers, homemakers, and caregivers**  
- **Farmers and peasants**  
- **Sex workers**  

## INS Data Collection Protocols and Classification

The **INS data collection protocols** state that the categories of violence‚Äî**"Physical," "Sexual", "Neglect and Abandonment,"** and **"Psychological"**‚Äîare:

- **Mutually exclusive**
- **Hierarchical**, where only the **most severe** type of violence is recorded [2]: 

### Hierarchy of Violence Categories
- **Sexual violence** is considered the most severe and is prioritised when multiple forms of violence occur against the same individual [2]: 
- Followed by:
  - **Physical violence**
  - **Psychological violence**
  - **Neglect and Abandonment** (ranked last) [2]: 

### Reclassification of Sexual Violence Categories
The variable **"Type of Sexual Violence"** originally included eight categories, which we reclassified into four categories based on:

- **Medico-legal definitions**
- **Case similarities**

### Table 2. INS Record‚Äôs Sexual Violence Categories and Definitions

| **New Categories** | **Original Categories** | **Definitions** |
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Sexual abuse and sexual harassment** | Sexual abuse | Non-consensual sexual acts, either through direct physical intrusion or threats, often in situations where there is a power imbalance, such as with minors or vulnerable individuals (7). |
|  | Sexual harassment | Unwelcome sexual behavior or advances, including verbal or physical actions, that create a hostile or offensive atmosphere. This can include sexual comments or demands that disrupt work or daily activities (7). |
| **Rape, sexual assault and sexual acts involving the use of force** | Rape | Forced, threat, or coerced penetration of the vulva or anus, using a penis, body parts, or objects. It is one of the most severe forms of sexual violence‚Äã (3,7). |
|  | Sexual assault and sexual acts involving the use of force | Broader range of non-consensual sexual contact, often including unwanted touching or groping, and can overlap with rape depending on the act. In Colombia, sexual assault is not a legal term (3,7). |
| **Sexual exploitation of minors and human trafficking for sexual exploitation** | Sexual exploitation of minors | The exploitation or coercion of individuals under 18 for sexual purposes, usually for profit, and classified as a form of aggravated sexual abuse (3,7). |
|  | Human trafficking for sexual exploitation | Illegal trade of individuals, primarily women and children, for the purpose of sex work, across or within borders, often involving forced labor, abuse, and violation of the victim‚Äôs rights as a condition for facilitating migration conditions (3). |
| **Other sexual acts (forced nudity, sterilization and contraception, female genital mutilation)** | Forced nudity, sterilization and contraception | Forced nudity is defined as non-consensual exposure of an individual‚Äôs body, often used as a form of humiliation or control. This category also includes the non-consensual sharing of photographs and images (8). |Forced sterilization involves the involuntary removal or blocking of reproductive organs (9). |Forced contraception is the coercion of an individual into using contraceptives methods against their will, often as a control tactic ‚Äã(8).
|  | Female genital mutilation | Any practice that includes removing part or all of the external female genitalia or causing harm to female genital organs without medical justification (10). |

### Data Reclassification and Variable Construction
This reclassification followed **national and international medico-legal** and **public health definitions**. Similar to the **"Type of violence"** classification, cases of **"Sexual violence"** record only the most severe subcategory, as determined by clinicians during routine evaluations‚Äînot by the victims (2).

- The **"Type of violence"** variable was constructed by combining two complementary original variables:  
  - **"Violence‚Äôs nature"**  
  - **"Type of sexual violence"**  

The final **"Type of violence"** categories were four mutually exclusive levels:

- **Physical violence**  
- **Sexual violence**  
- **Psychological violence**  
- **Neglect and abandonment**  

Meanwhile, the variable **"Type of sexual violence"** (applicable only to cases classified as **"Sexual violence"**) was retained in the four categories detailed in **Table 2**.

### Aggressor Category Consolidation
All known aggressors from the original variable **"Non-family relationship with the aggressor"** were combined into a single category, which includes:

- **"Teacher/Professor"**, **"Friend"**, **"Coworker"**, **"Classmate"**, **"Other acquaintance"**, **"Neighbor"**, **"Acquaintance with no close interaction"**, **"Boss"**, **"Priest/Pastor"**, and **"Public servant"**.  
- The **"Unknown"** category was retained.  

The final categories are:

- **"Known but not family"**  
- **"Unknown and not family"**  

This was then combined with the original variable, **"Survivor‚Äôs family relationship with the aggressor"**, to create a new variable: **"Survivor‚Äôs relationship with the aggressor"**.

### Injury Mechanism Reclassification
The original variable **"Injury mechanism"** was grouped into four final levels based on:

- **Response percentages lower than 5%**
- **Content similarity**

The final levels are:

- **"Blunt, cutting, stabbing, and related injuries"**  
- **"Falls, firearm projectiles, and others"**  
- **"Hanging, strangulation, suffocation"**  
- **"Burns (water, acid, alkalis, household substances)"**  

### Event Location Consolidation
The original variable **"Event‚Äôs location"** was consolidated into two groups:

- **"Household"**  
- **"Public Spaces"**  

### Retained Variables
The following variables were retained as in the original datasets:

- **"Survivor‚Äôs sex"**  
- **"Survivor‚Äôs gender identity"**  
- **"Survivor‚Äôs sexual orientation"**  
- **"Survivor as head of household"**  
- **"Survivor‚Äôs current pregnancy status"**  
- **"Co-living with the aggressor"**  
- **"Aggressor‚Äôs sex"**  

(See Table 1 for further details.)
