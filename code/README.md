# 📁 Code Folder

This folder contains all R scripts used for data preparation, analysis, and export in the study. Scripts are named sequentially to reflect their order of execution.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Due to data confidentiality, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, the code used to process and analyze the data is fully available for transparency and reproducibility.

---

## 🔧 Script Overview

- `00_setup.R`: Installs and loads all required R packages.
- `01_data_cleaning.R`: Imports and prepares the data, including variable recoding and transformations.
- `02_data_exploration_and_manipulation.R`: Performs summary statistics and descriptive analyses.
- `03_analysis_mca.R`: Conducts Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).
- `04_tables_export.R`: Generates and exports tables for the manuscript.
- `05_graphs_export.R`: Creates and exports relevant visualizations.

## 🧹 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

Each annual dataset (2017–2022) underwent a standardized and reproducible data cleaning process, implemented in a consistent R script. The procedure included:

- **Importing raw data** from Excel files with `readxl`
- **Initial inspection** using functions like `summary()` and `names()`
- **Selection of relevant variables** based on a predefined protocol
- **Renaming variables** to ensure consistency across years
- **Type conversion** for dates, categorical, and numerical variables using `lubridate`, `dplyr`, and `forcats`
- **Re-labeling categories** according to official coding dictionaries from the INS
- **Recoding unknown or inconsistent values**
- **Systematic handling of missing data**
- **Exporting the cleaned datasets** as `.Rds` and `.RData` files

> ⚠️ The same procedure was applied to all yearly datasets (2017–2022), with small adjustments for structural differences between years.

You can explore the full cleaning procedure in the script [`01_data_cleaning.R`](./code/01_data_cleaning.R).


## 🧮 2. Data Manipulation and Exploration

This script performs a standardized transformation and aggregation of variables for the 2017 dataset. While the previous script (`01_data_cleaning.R`) focused on raw data cleaning and recoding based on the original dictionary, this script prepares the dataset for analysis through:

- **Temporal validation** of notification and event dates (`fech.not`, `fech.hech`)
- **Categorization of age** into meaningful age groups according to national health standards
- **Re-labeling and re-grouping** of:
  - Sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, nationality, occupation)
  - Social security status
  - Ethnic background
  - Belonging to "vulnerable" or priority populations
  - Departmental origin (`dep.ocu`) into regional planning groups
- **Thematic groupings** of key variables:
  - Type of violence (`tipo.viol`)
  - Mechanism of aggression (`mecanismo.cat`)
  - Location of aggression (`escena.cat`)
  - Survivor activity (`activi.cat`)
  - Aggressor relationship (`relacion`)
- **Missing values handling** and creation of interpretable labels for statistical analysis
- **Creation of secondary variables** that simplify or condense granular data into analytic-friendly formats (e.g., `ocup.cat`, `v.sexual.cat`)

> ✅ The same structure will be applied to all yearly datasets (2017–2022) using similarly named scripts (e.g. `02_data_manipulation_2018.R`, etc.) to ensure full reproducibility and consistency across years.

Cleaned and manipulated datasets are saved in `.Rds` format at the end of the script (`vio.2017.b`).
