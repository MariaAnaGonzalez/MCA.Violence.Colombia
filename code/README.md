## üßπ 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

Each annual dataset (2017‚Äì2022) underwent a standardized and reproducible data cleaning process, implemented in a consistent R script. The procedure included:

- **Importing raw data** from Excel files with readxl
- **Initial inspection** using functions like summary() and names()
- **Selection of relevant variables** based on a predefined protocol
- **Renaming variables** to ensure consistency across years
- **Type conversion** for dates, categorical, and numerical variables using lubridate, dplyr, and forcats
- **Re-labeling categories** according to official coding dictionaries from the INS
- **Recoding unknown or inconsistent values**
- **Systematic handling of missing data**
- **Exporting the cleaned datasets** as .Rds and .RData files

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The same procedure was applied to all yearly datasets (2017‚Äì2022), with small adjustments for structural differences between years.

You can explore the full cleaning procedure in the script [01_data_cleaning.R](./code/01_data_cleaning.R).


## üßÆ 2. Data Manipulation and Exploration

<details>
<summary>üîπ Step A: Standard Variable Transformation</summary>

This script performs a standardized transformation and aggregation of variables for the 2017‚Äì2022 datasets. While the previous script (01_data_cleaning.R) focused on raw data cleaning and recoding based on the original dictionary, this step prepares the dataset for analysis through:

- **Temporal validation** of notification and event dates (fech.not, fech.hech)
- **Categorization of age** into meaningful age groups according to national health standards
- **Re-labeling and re-grouping** of:
  - Sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, nationality, occupation)
  - Social security status
  - Ethnic background
  - Belonging to "vulnerable" or priority populations
  - Departmental origin (dep.ocu) into regional planning groups
- **Thematic groupings** of key variables:
  - Type of violence (tipo.viol)
  - Mechanism of aggression (mecanismo.cat)
  - Location of aggression (escena.cat)
  - Survivor activity (activi.cat)
  - Aggressor relationship (relacion)
- **Missing values handling** and creation of interpretable labels for statistical analysis
- **Creation of secondary variables** that simplify or condense granular data into analytic-friendly formats (e.g., ocup.cat, v.sexual.cat)

Cleaned and manipulated datasets are saved in .Rds format at the end of each script (e.g., vio.2017.b).

<summary>üîπ Step B: Time Analysis (2020 Focus)</summary>

This component adds a temporal dimension to the 2020 dataset by distinguishing between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods:

- **Creation of binary classification variables**:
  - periodo.hecho: Based on the event date (fech.hech) ‚Äî labeled as "Prepandemic" or "Pandemic"
  - periodo.not: Based on the notification date (fech.not) ‚Äî same classification
- **Validation of these variables**: Checked for consistency and absence of missing values
- **Comparison of both period variables** to ensure overlap and alignment
- The 2020 dataset was then split into vio.2020.before and vio.2020.pandemic, and merged accordingly with previous and later years.

</details>

<details>
<summary>üîπ Step C: Time Delay Computation (2017‚Äì2022)</summary>

For each year, the following steps were performed:

- Computation of the time difference (dif.dias) between the date of the event and the date of notification
- **Summary statistics**: min, max, mean, median, SD, range
- **Visualization**: Yearly histograms were created and saved in PNG and PDF formats to visualize the distribution of reporting delays
- Filtering of outliers:
  - Cases with **negative time differences** (possible date inconsistencies)
  - Cases with **delays over 30 days**, for further descriptive analysis

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>üîπ Final Outputs</summary>

- Yearly datasets enriched with the new variable dif.dias were saved as .Rds and .RData files (e.g., vio.2017.c, vio.2022.c)
- Combined histograms summarizing delay distributions were exported as:
  - histo.dif.dates.all.png
  - histo.dif.dates.all.pdf
- A new classification variable periodo was added to label all records as "Pandemic" or "Prepandemic"
- All datasets were **merged into a single unified dataset** (vio.todo) for full-period comparative analysis

> ‚úÖ The same structure was applied to all yearly datasets (2017‚Äì2022) using similarly named scripts (e.g., 02_data_manipulation_2018.R) to ensure full reproducibility and consistency across years.
