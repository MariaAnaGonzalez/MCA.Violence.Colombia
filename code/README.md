## üßπ 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

<details>
<summary>Initials</summary>

Each annual dataset (2017‚Äì2022) underwent a standardized and reproducible data cleaning process, implemented in a consistent R script. The procedure included:

- Importing raw data from Excel files with `readxl`
- Initial inspection using functions like `summary()` and `names()`
- Selection of relevant variables based on a predefined protocol
- Renaming variables to ensure consistency across years
- Type conversion for dates, categorical, and numerical variables using `lubridate`, `dplyr`, and `forcats`
- Re-labeling categories according to official coding dictionaries from the INS
- Recoding unknown or inconsistent values
- Systematic handling of missing data
- Exporting the cleaned datasets as `.Rds` and `.RData` files

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The same procedure was applied to all yearly datasets (2017‚Äì2022), with small adjustments for structural differences between years.

You can explore the full cleaning procedure in the script [`01_data_cleaning.R`](./code/01_data_cleaning.R).
</details>

## üßÆ 2. Data Manipulation and Exploration

<details>
<summary>Standard Variable Transformation</summary>

This script performs a standardized transformation and aggregation of variables for the 2017‚Äì2022 datasets. While the previous script (`01_data_cleaning.R`) focused on raw data cleaning and recoding, this step prepares the dataset for analysis through:

- Temporal validation of notification and event dates (`fech.not`, `fech.hech`)
- Categorization of age into meaningful age groups according to national health standards
- Re-labeling and grouping of sociodemographic variables
- Thematic grouping of violence-related variables
- Creation of simplified secondary variables
- Export of cleaned datasets

</details>

<details>
<summary>Time Analysis (2020 Focus)</summary>

This section focuses on temporal segmentation of the 2020 dataset:

- Creation of binary classification variables (`periodo.hecho` and `periodo.not`)
- Validation and consistency checks
- Splitting and merging into `vio.2020.before` and `vio.2020.pandemic`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Time Delay Computation (2017‚Äì2022)</summary>

For each year:

- Computed time difference (`dif.dias`) between event and notification
- Summary statistics and delay distribution histograms
- Filtering of negative or long-delay cases for inspection

</details>

<details>
<summary>Final Outputs</summary>

- Enriched datasets saved as `.c` files (e.g., `vio.2017.c`)
- Export of yearly and combined histograms
- Unified dataset `vio.todo` created with pandemic/prepandemic labels

> ‚úÖ Consistent naming and structure were maintained for reproducibility.

You can explore the full procedure in the script [`02_data_exploration_and_manipulation.R`](./code/02_data_exploration_and_manipulation.R).
</details>

---

## üßæ 3. Descriptive Analysis

<details>
<summary>Description by Sex and Period</summary>

Stratified descriptive summaries were performed for each sex and pandemic period using:

- `describe()` for continuous variables
- `tabyl()` + `adorn_pct_formatting()` for categorical summaries

Datasets analyzed:

- `vio.before.female`, `vio.before.male`
- `vio.pandemic.female`, `vio.pandemic.male`

Variables include age, gender identity, occupation, type of violence, and more.

> ‚úÖ Outputs were saved for further stratification by age group.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Description by Age Cohort</summary>

Further stratification was performed into:

- Children (0‚Äì17): Early childhood, Childhood, Adolescence
- Adults (18+): Youth, Adulthood, Older adult

Each sex-period combination was split and described. Factor levels were cleaned and summaries exported.

> ‚úÖ This allows deeper insight into how violence patterns differ by age, sex, and pandemic timing.

You can explore the full procedure in the script [`03_descriptive_analysis.R`](./code/03_descriptive_analysis.R).

# üéØ 4. Final Analysis: Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) 

This section summarizes the complete MCA process performed on three datasets:
- `vio.before`: Prepandemic period
- `vio.pandemic`: Pandemic period
- `vio.todo`: Combined dataset (2017‚Äì2022)

The analysis includes variable selection, cleaning and recoding, MCA execution, visualization (2D and 3D), and export of results.

---

## üìÅ A. Data Preparation for MCA

### Variable Selection and Renaming - Quality Control 

For each dataset (`before`, `pandemic`, `todo`):
- Selected 10‚Äì11 variables: `sexo`, `activi.cat`, `antec.vio`, `sexo.agre`, `conv.agre`, `mecanismo.cat`, `escena.cat`, `edad.cat`, `tipo.viol`, `relacion` (+ `periodo` for `todo`)
- Renamed variables into English for clarity (e.g., `sexo` ‚Üí `Sex`, `tipo.viol` ‚Üí `Violence`)
- Translated categorical levels (e.g., "S√≠" ‚Üí "Yes")
- Corrected typos in levels (e.g., "Phsychological" ‚Üí "Psychological")

---

## üìä B. MCA Execution

###  MCA per Dataset

- Used `MCA(..., ncp = 3)` from the `FactoMineR` package
- Extracted eigenvalues using `get_eigenvalue()`
- Saved MCA objects for future use

###  Scree Plots

Generated scree plots with `fviz_screeplot()`:
- Added red dashed line at 4.9% for retained variability threshold
- Saved as `.pdf` (e.g., `Screeplot.vio.prepandemic.pdf`)

---

## üìà C. Variable Category Plots

###  2D MCA Variable Plots

Generated biplots for variable categories using `fviz_mca_var()` for:
- Dim 1 vs 2
- Dim 1 vs 3
- Dim 2 vs 3

Combined into a vertical layout using `patchwork::plot_layout()` and saved (e.g., `variables.MCA.vio.DIM.todo.before.pdf`)

###  Enhanced Variable Plots with Labels

- Added custom labels using `geom_text_repel()`
- Highlighted key labels in bold (e.g., "Sexual violence")
- Used `viridis` palette for quadrant shading
- Exported with suffix `.quadrant.pdf`

###  3D MCA Plot of Variable Categories

- Used `plotly::plot_ly()` for interactive 3D scatter plots
- Colored points and labeled axes by explained variance
- Saved as `.html` (e.g., `3D_MCA_Categories_with_Quadrants.html`)

---

## üë§ D. Individual Records Plot (by Violence Type)

###  2D Individual Plot

- Colored individuals by `Violence` type
- Added ellipses per group with `fviz_mca_ind()`
- Used `viridis_d` palette for clarity

###  3D Individual Plot

- Created 3D scatter plot of individuals grouped by `Violence` using `plot_ly()`
- Added color legend with hover info
- Exported as `.html` (e.g., `3D_MCA_individuals_todo.html`)
